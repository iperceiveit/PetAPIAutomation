## Potential Issues

### 1. Path and Operation Consistency

- The method to update the pet should be `PUT`. The service is implemented correctly. But API specification in the swagger is not correct. It has been listed as `POST`
- Consider changing the `POST` method for updating a pet at `/pet/{petId}` to `PUT` or `PATCH` for better RESTful practice.
- To update the exsisting element, the best approach is to use HTTP Method `PUT` instead of `POST`.
- Update the HTTP method from `post` to `delete` in the resource `/pet/{petId}/remove` and also no need to create a new resource `/remove` instead update the exsiting resource with new HTTP method `delete` because The HTTP protocol provides specific methods for operations `(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)`, and using these methods as intended leverages the built-in capabilities of HTTP clients, servers, and intermediaries.
- The `DELETE` method clearly communicates the intention to remove a resource, making the API more intuitive
- It adheres to RESTful standards and conventions, which improves the predictability and consistency of the API.

So the best approach is to change the resource as `/pet/{petId}` - `DELETE`

### 2. Schema Validations

- Add a validation for both request and response schema.
- The response schema can be either xml or json, so its better to add Accept-Header in the response to explicitly informing the user that it returns either `JSON` or `XML`.
- Ensure the `name`,`category` field's max length is suitable for the application needs.
- Ensure to have `age` minimum value as 0.

### 3. Responses

- Ensure below response code are updated and implemented correctly for each path

#### Path
 
## ```/api/pet``` - `POST` ADD NEW PET

 Possible Response codes to implement:

- 200 OK when the request is successfull and does not create a resource
- 201 Created - When the request is successfull and a new resource is created
- 400 bad request. When the request format is not met
- 503 service unavailable - When the product server is not up and running

## ```/api/pet/{petId}``` - `GET`  RETRIEVE PET BY ID

 Possible Response codes to implement:

- 200 OK: Pet Found, returning the pet details in JSON or XML format.
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid ID supplied, returning an error message.
- 404 Not Found: Pet not found, returning an error message.
- 500 Internal Server Error: Internal Server Error, returning a generic error message.

## ```/api/pet/{petId}``` - `PUT`  UPDATE EXSISTING PET

 Possible Response codes to implement:
 
- 200: Pet updated successfully, returning the updated pet details.
- 400: Invalid input, returning an error message.
- 404: Pet not found, returning an error message.
- 422: Unprocessable Entity, used for validation errors, returning detailed error messages.
- 500: Internal Server Error, returning a generic error message.

## ```/pet/{petId}/remove``` - `POST` DELETE AN EXSISTING PET ELEMENT

 Possible Response codes to implement:

- 200 OK: Successful Operation by adding the description as resource was deleted. This status code can also include a response body with confirmation or details about the deletion.
- 204 No Content: Successful Operation and the resource was deleted. This status code does not include a response body, indicating that the server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send.
- 400 Bad Request: This can be implemented when the client sends an invalid ID or other malformed data.
- 404 Not Found: This status code is returned when the resource specified by the ID does not exist.
- 500 Internal Server Error: The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle. This status code indicates a generic server error.

### 4. Schema Definitions:

- The `Pet` schema is well-defined, but all constraints (like `maxLength`, `mandatory`) are suitable for application's requirements.
- Response Schema is different for each resource. Properly mentioning the response scheme helps the user to identify the api calls correctly. 
- API Error/Fault schema has to be defined in such a way if there is any `4xx` or `5xx` error occured.  

### 5. Request and Response Consistency:

- Verify that the request body and response schema references (`#/components/schemas/Pet`) are correctly resolving within the document.

For example in the resource `api/pet` while creating new pet, the response should contains `id` but when we see the schema definition it returns PET schema which doesnt have any ID. So make sure a proper response schema is defined. 

```json
 responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet' --> ````This doesnt satisfied the response. Either Add ID to the response schema or remove other attirbutes and keep ID to the response. ````
            application/xml:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
```

### 6. Documentation Consistency:

- Ensure that descriptions, summaries, and parameter definitions are consistent and clear across all paths.
